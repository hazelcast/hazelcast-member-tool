### Install manually with archive package

Please download the latest archive package from this repository's [releases section](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-command-line/releases). Once you downloaded, you can extract it and start using Hazelcast Command Line as follows:

```
$ wget https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-command-line/releases/download/v4.2020.12/hazelcast-4.1.1.tar.gz
$ tar -xzvf hazelcast-4.1.1.tar.gz
$ cd hazelcast-4.1.1/bin
$ ./hz
``` 

## Basic Usages

### How to start a Hazelcast member

Please run the following command to start a Hazelcast member with default configuration:

```
$ hz start
``` 

### How to start a Hazelcast member with custom configuration

Please run the following command to start a Hazelcast member with custom configuration:

```
$ hz start -c /full/path/to/config-file.yaml
``` 

Please note that only XML and YAML configurations are supported and a full path is required. If `-c, --config=<file>` option is not set then the configuration file at `[INSTALLATION_DIR]/config/hazelcast.yaml` is used. You can update this file to configure starting Hazelcast members.

Additionally, you can see which file is used to configure Hazelcast instance at the first log line after start. Please see an example output below:

```
$ hz start
Aug 21, 2020 1:40:04 PM com.hazelcast.config.FileSystemYamlConfig
INFO: Configuring Hazelcast from '/Users/myuser/hazelcast-command-line/distro/build/dist/config/hazelcast.yaml'.
...
``` 

### How to start a Hazelcast member with additional Java options

The following command will allow you to start a Hazelcast member with additional Java options:

```
$ hz start -J <option1>,<option2>
``` 

You can use `,` to separate multiple options. Please note that class path settings (such as `-cp`, `-jar`) are **not** allowed (See [this section](#how-to-start-a-hazelcast-member-with-additional-classpath) to add classes or JAR files to the classpath).

### How to start a Hazelcast member with additional classpath

You can run the following command to start a Hazelcast member with additional classes or JAR files in the classpath:

```
$ hz start -j <path1>,<path2>
```

Please use `,` to separate multiple paths to classes or JAR files. 

When you run `hz start` command with any available option, it starts a Hazelcast instance in the foreground. Please use Ctrl+C (SIGINT) to gracefully stop the running instance. 

For all other available options, refer to `hz start --help`. 

### How to start a Hazelcast Management Center

Please run the following command to start a Hazelcast Management Center with default configuration:

```
$ hz mc start
``` 

### How to start a Hazelcast Management Center with custom context path and port

To start a Hazelcast Management Center with custom context path and port, please run the following command:

```
$ hz mc start -c [new-context-path] -p [port]
``` 

For instance, if you run with `hz mc start -c my-management-center -p 9000` Management Center starts at `http://localhost:9000/my-management-center`.

### How to start a Hazelcast Management Center with additional Java options

The following command will allow you to start a Hazelcast Management Center with additional Java options:

```
$ hz mc start -J <option1>,<option2>
``` 

You can use `,` to separate multiple options. Please note that class path settings (such as `-cp`, `-jar`) are **not** allowed. 

When you run `hz mc start` command with any available option, it starts a Hazelcast Management Center instance in the foreground. Please use Ctrl+C (SIGINT) to gracefully stop the running instance. 

For all other available options, refer to `hz mc start --help`. 

### How to print version information

```
$ hz -V
CLI tool: 4.2020.12
Hazelcast: 4.1.1
Hazelcast Management Center: 4.2020.12
```

```
cd build/dist/hazelcast-{hazelcast.version}/bin
